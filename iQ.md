* Bitflow version compatibility
  * iQ3 is bundled with bitflow 5.7 and driver pack 3.8. Installation disrupts the bitflow driver (iQ: camera not found; MM: program quit).
  * cannot remove bitflow 5.7 after installation (unknown reason)
  * System restore also restores removed packages
  * Be super cautious! After system restoration, packages cannot be removed: invalid uninstall control file (actually, there is no such file at all). 
  * potential workaround (not tested): remove driver pack and bitflow, install iQ3, remove driver pack and bitflow, install driver pack again (follow the MM instructions)
